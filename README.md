# Digital-Clock

This digital clock is a hex clock that reflects the time of day in #hhmmss format instead of hh:mm:ss format. The color of the digits of the clock is then changed based on the hex code which is created by the current time. The clock also displays a background image to the user with the time and a custom greeting based on the time of day.
